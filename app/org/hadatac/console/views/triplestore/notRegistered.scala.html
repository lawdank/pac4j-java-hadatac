        <p><b>Explanation</b>: The email that you provided is not in the list of user emails pre-approved to 
        log into HADatAc as <i>org.hadatac.data owners</i>. Once your email address has been added to the list of pre-approved

        <p><b>How to proceed</b>: HADatAc administrators are responsible for user pre-registration. Please 
        contact your HADatAc administrator and ask to be pre-registered. Please make sure that you have been
        pre-registered before you try to sign-up again.</p>
